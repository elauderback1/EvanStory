There was a young who grew up on a small farm in the middle of no where, he worked tirelessly for his father and rarely got to leave the property. This
young man simply wanted to find his way in the world. His recently deceased father sheltered him for all of his life but now there is nothing 
holding him back. The young man sets out on a journey to discover the world he has been deprived of. He travels to a city, the first he's ever seen, and is 
amazed. He sees thousands of people of all different assortments and he couldn't contain his excitement, he wanted to meet as many as he could. 
Unfortunately, due to his sheltering as a boy, the young man had never learned the danger in talking to strangers. He approached a man selling knives
on the street.
