There was a young who grew up on a small farm in the middle of no where, he worked tirelessly for his father and rarely got to leave the property. This
young man simply wanted to find his way in the world. His recently deceased father sheltered him for all of his life but now there is nothing 
holding him back. The young man sets out on a journey to discover the world he has been deprived of. He travels to a city, the first he's ever seen, and is 
amazed. He sees thousands of people of all different assortments and he couldn't contain his excitement, he wanted to meet as many as he could. 
Unfortunately, due to his sheltering as a boy, the young man had never learned the danger in talking to strangers. He approached a man selling knives
on the street.
"Whatchya lookin' to buy?" the knife salesmen said in a thick New York/Ittalian accent. Appreciating the salesmens welcoming attitude, the young man explained, 
"Well I don't have much money, but are you looking to hire a hard worker such as myself?" The salesmen, realizing the young man was strong from his farm work,
called his boss and agreed to hire the young man on the spot. "Okay, kid," the entrepenuer said, "Your first job is to make a 'ahem' withdrawl from the bank
on Sixth and Jefferson Street. Come back with at least twenty large and you'll have yourself a full-time position for my Uncle Vinnie."
